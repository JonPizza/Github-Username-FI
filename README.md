# Github-Username-FI

FI because I accidently pressed "ENTER" instead of "N" while I was typing "FINDER"

Anyways, it finds 2 letter usernames on GitHub, if there are any.

Also it is really cool.

I'll make it good later.

I really want a 2 letter username.

No real reason tho.

I just think it would be cool.

Made while racing @mfekadu to find the first 2 letter username.

Inspired by @1000000000
